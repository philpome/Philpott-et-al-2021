To better understand the genetic diversity and gene flow of American ginseng, we studied RAPD variation in cultivated and wild populations. Classical and Bayesian analogues of genetic diversity statistics were estimated in seven wild and two cultivated populations. The wild populations were more highly structured (G (st beta) = 0.41) than the cultivated populations (G (st beta) = 0.24). The genetic diversity within populations ranged from H (e beta) = 0.05 to 0.38. Based on genetic pairwise distances, six of the wild populations clustered with the locally-derived cultivated population, while one wild population was more similar to the non-local cultivated population than the local populations. This wild population was highly diverse (P = 1.0; U = 1.0) suggesting that it was supplemented from exotic seed. A set of eight RAPD markers was identified that differentiated plants of local and non-local origin. As a conservation strategy, we recommend that regional gene banks be established based on molecular and geographic diversity to preserve the locally adapted germplasm. These regional gene banks would serve as a conservation tool and also provide a source of genes for genetic improvement of cultivated ginseng.","[Schlag, Erin M.; McIntosh, Marla S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"McIntosh, MS (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",eschlag1@swarthmore.edu; mmcintos@umd.edu,"McIntosh, Marla S./A-3441-2011","McIntosh, Marla S./0000-0002-4169-8615",Maryland Department of Agriculture,Maryland Department of Agriculture,"The authors thank R.

These strategies represent a major undertaking the field of plant genetic resources, mobilizing experts to collaboratively plan for the more efficient and effective conservation and use of crop diversity. The strategies are reviewed for eight themes: regeneration, crop wild relatives, collecting, crop descriptors, information systems, user priorities, new technologies and research, and challenges to building a strategy for rational conservation. The themes shed light upon the status, constraints, and promising directions regarding ex situ conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources globally, and provide insight into the current challenges to planning for an efficient and effective global system. The primary constraints affecting conservation, use, and planning are the quality and availability of accession-level information, and availability of resources for regeneration, collecting, and research. A series of connected organizations working at the global level are addressing some of the major constraints in regeneration, collecting, information systems, descriptors, user involvement, and new technology development, although certain crops and regions will need additional support beyond the activities currently funded, particularly in collecting and in the development of specific conservation technologies. Achieving an efficient and effective global system will depend on active support by stakeholders, and will be aided by continuing to develop the strategies and by supporting the strategies' recommendations for efficient and effective practices in plant genetic resources.","[Khoury, Colin; Guarino, Luigi] UN, FAO, Global Crop Div Trust, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Laliberte, Brigitte] Biovers Int, SGRP, CGIAR, I-00057 Maccarese, Fiumicino, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Alliance; Bioversity International; CGIAR,"Khoury, C (corresponding author), UN, FAO, Global Crop Div Trust, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",colin.khoury@croptrust.org,"Khoury, Colin K./AAA-1864-2020","Khoury, Colin K./0000-0001-7893-5744",Grains Research and Development Corporation; Global Crop Diversity Trust,Grains Research and Development Corporation(Grains R&D Corp); Global Crop Diversity Trust,"Financial support for the development of the strategies came from the Grains Research and Development Corporation and the Global Crop Diversity Trust.

Because the targets of international conservation policy focus very little on the conservation of genetic diversity in wild species, they have received little attention from the plant conservation genetics community. Conservation policymakers should more explicitly include the conservation of genetic diversity of wild species in future targets to ensure that this important aspect of biodiversity is not overlooked for the majority of species on earth and to attain more buy-in from the plant conservation genetics community; I highlight specific ways in which policymakers may more explicitly include genetic diversity in international policy targets. For their part, conservation geneticists need to conduct work that will advance the big-picture goals of conservation policy; here, I discuss specific actions that plant conservation geneticists can take, such as measuring the proportion of genetic diversity that is protected, designing experiments in such a way to measure genetic erosion, and developing protocols to increase the efficiency of ex situ collection efforts. By working together, plant conservation geneticists and conservation policymakers will more effectively accomplish the shared goal of halting the loss of plant biodiversity.","[Edwards, Christine E.] Missouri Bot Garden, Ctr Conservat & Sustainable Dev, POB 299, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",Missouri Botanical Gardens,"Edwards, CE (corresponding author), Missouri Bot Garden, Ctr Conservat & Sustainable Dev, POB 299, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",christine.edwards@mobot.org,"Edwards, Christine/P-1324-2014","Edwards, Christine/0000-0001-8837-4872",,,,,80,2,2,1,15,MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN,ST LOUIS,"2345 TOWER GROVE AVENUE, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA",0026-6493,2162-4372,,ANN MO BOT GARD,Ann.

However, our understanding of the effectiveness of conservation guidelines for maintaining genetic diversity in situ is limited. Furthermore, we lack information on how species-level variation in mating system affects these genetic conservation strategies. We used the British geographical ranges of eight widespread but declining plant species, varying in breeding system, as a model to assess the effectiveness of guidelines for the in-situ conservation of neutral genetic diversity. By applying simulated in-situ conservation scenarios to amplified fragment length polymorphism data, we show that the conservation of one population (the minimum-set approach) would retain similar to 70% of common allelic variation, but few or no rare alleles (alleles with frequency <= 0.05). Our results indicate that the conservation of >35% of populations would be needed to reach the Convention on Biological Diversity's recommendation to conserve 70% of genetic diversity in situ, as applied to rare alleles (similar to 10 populations within each species' British range). The capture of genetic variation in simulated conservation networks was insensitive to breeding system. However, a spatially stratified approach to population selection led to significantly greater capture rates for common alleles in two of our study species, relative to a spatially random strategy. Our study highlights the challenges of conserving genetic variation, and emphasises the vulnerability of genetic biodiversity to reductions in the extent of species' ranges. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The IGB is set up to preserve plant genetic resources and the endangered genetic variability of the Israeli flora. Upon its inauguration, we consulted with the country's leading plant breeders and botanists in an attempt to create a list of the most important plant species to be included in the initial collections. The list includes crop wild relatives (CWRs), selected according to their contribution to humans: edible plants (grains, vegetables, oil); forage plants; species with potential industrial and biotechnological applications (e.g. spices, medicinal plants, aromatic plants, fibers, dyes), and species with horticultural and forestry potential. We further ranked the species on the basis of assessed values for each of seven characteristics: distribution range in the country; abundance; rarity of the growing habitats; endemism; red number index-representing imminent threat of extinction; availability of samples in Israeli collections, and genetic relationship to cultivated crops. The sum of the assessed values for these seven characteristics was used to group the species on the list into four main prioritized-collection schemes. Statistical analysis indicated that all attributes had similar influence on the collecting prioritization scheme. in general, rare species with low abundance in their growing habitats were ranked in the highest priority group, while highly distributed species were sorted together into a lower priority group. The prioritization scheme will be used to optimize the collection in the IGB with the aim of establishing its collecting activities. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study revealed that C. macranthos var. rebunense has relatively high genetic diversity (P was 0.62, n (a) and n (e) were 1.85 and 1.28 respectively, and H (o) and H (e) were 0.163 and 0.187, respectively) when compared with other plant taxa. The natural habitats of C. macranthos var. rebunense are geographically separated into northern and the southern populations. Disappearance of alleles and increase in homozygosity expected as a result of the bottleneck effect were observed, particularly in the southern populations composed of a small number of plants. As additional negative effects (inbreeding depression and further genetic drift) due to fragmentation are predicted in these populations, the southern populations may show deterioration of genetic diversity in the near future.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; Hokkaido Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0628516, Japan; Hokkaido Univ Museum, Sect Fundamental & Curatorial Studies, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan",Hokkaido University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Hokkaido University,"Izawa, T (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",ti@museum.hokudai.ac.jp,,,,,,,52,22,25,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1566-0621,1572-9737,,CONSERV GENET,Conserv.

However, the genetic diversity of the entire extant natural and ex situ populations has not been assessed to date. In this study, we evaluated the genetic diversity and structure of six natural populations and a single ex situ population (the only known ex situ population of L. subcordatum) using sequence-related amplified polymorphism data. Results: In total, 553 reliable DNA bands, of which 359 (63.28%) were polymorphic, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with combinations of 15 primers. Low average gene diversity within populations and high genetic differentiation were detected in L. subcordatum. A Mantel test demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances, indicating that significant genetic divergence was likely the result of geographic isolation among natural populations. Furthermore, based on genetic structure patterns, populations of L. subcordatum were divided into three clusters. Group 1 was composed of specimens from Libo, Guizhou Province (GZ) and Huanjiang, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GX). Group 2 was composed of Mt. Wuguishan, Guangdong Province (GD). Group 3 was composed of three populations in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Additionally, clonal reproduction probably existed in GD population. According to the genetic information analysis and field survey, the ex situ population did not match its source population (GD) in terms of genetics, and its habitat was different from the original natural habitat. We observed that a few individual GD seeds were needed to improve ZS ex situ in the future. Conclusions: Compared to previous SRAP-based studies of endangered plants, L. subcordatum had extremely low average gene diversity within populations and high genetic differentiation among populations. At present, the unique ex situ population has not been successful due to non-representative samples being taken, a smaller population size, and man-made changes in habitat. Potential strategies are suggested to improve the conservation of this species.","[Li, Bai-Jun; Wang, Jie-Yu; Liu, Zhong-Jian; Zhuang, Xue-Ying; Huang, Jiu-Xiang] South China Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Landscape Architecture, South China Limestone Plants Res Ctr, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Bai-Jun] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forestry, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Li, Bai-Jun; Wang, Jie-Yu; Liu, Zhong-Jian] Natl Orchid Conservat Ctr China, Shenzhen Key Lab Orchid Conservat & Utilizat, Shenzhen 518114, Peoples R China; [Li, Bai-Jun; Wang, Jie-Yu; Liu, Zhong-Jian] Orchid Conservat & Res Ctr Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518114, Peoples R China","South China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forestry, CAF","Huang, JX (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Landscape Architecture, South China Limestone Plants Res Ctr, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",jxhuang@scau.edu.cn,"wang, jie/GRS-0942-2022",,"Research Project of the Protection of Small Population and Wild Plant Loropetalum subcordatum in Zhongshan, Research Programme; Zhongshan's Conservation Center of State-owned Forest Resource","Research Project of the Protection of Small Population and Wild Plant Loropetalum subcordatum in Zhongshan, Research Programme; Zhongshan's Conservation Center of State-owned Forest Resource","This study was financially supported by The Research Project of the Protection of Small Population and Wild Plant Loropetalum subcordatum in Zhongshan, Research Programme sponsored by Zhongshan's Conservation Center of State-owned Forest Resource.",,68,9,12,1,18,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2156,,,BMC GENET,BMC Genet.,13-Feb,2018,19,,,,,,,,12,10.1186/s12863-018-0599-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-018-0599-6,,,11,Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Genetics & Heredity,FW6SR,29439656,"Green Published, gold",,,3/27/23,WOS:000425449100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Assessment of extent of genetic diversity/variability is also important to monitor genetic erosion within a species. In threatened plant species, genetic diversity assessment helps in selection of genetically diverse populations to enrich the genetically impoverished populations, thus minimizing the probability of genetic drift. Confirming taxonomic identity of threatened species, particularly those belonging to species complexes with dispute identity, is another essential task in the conservation of threatened species, which is best resolved through molecular approaches. The present study estimated the genetic variability within and among the populations of four threatened species, viz. Justicia beddomei (C.B. Clarke) Bennet (Acanthaceae), Embelia ribes Burm. f. (Myrsinaceae), Madhuca insignis (Radlk.) H.J. Lam (Sapotaceae) and Cycas beddomei Dyer Cycadaceae) using Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) and Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers for selecting the genetically diverse populations. The phylogeny was analysed through ITS (nrDNA) and matK (cpDNA) sequences to confirm the species identity. The phylogenetic analyses confirmed four distinct species of Justicia, which also revealed that J. beddomei and J. adhatoda were sister groups with a common ancestor showing rapid parallel speciation with J. gendarussa in one clade and J. betonica in another. Madhuca insignis with extremely small population in the Western Ghats (Karnataka to Kerala) might have undergone either extensive hybridization or incipient speciation. In case of Embelia species, a greater evolutionary closeness between E. subcoraceae and E. floribunda was revealed, while E. ribes had a distinct clad. Both ISSR and SSR markers distinguished various genotypes of Cycas beddomei.","[Chrungoo, N. K.; Nongbet, A.; Hynniewta, M.; Barik, S.

The flora of the Sinai Peninsula is unique and, therefore, of strong interest. However, in only few studies genetic structure and variation within and among populations of Sinai plants have been analysed. In the study presented here, we analysed the genetic structure of Hypericum sinaicum and Origanum syriacum subsp. sinaicum, which are two rare respectively near-endemic and endemic medicinal perennial plants with overlapping ranges restricted to the mountainous region of southern Sinai in Egypt. Methods and key results - We used AFLP markers and calculated standard genetic diversity measures. Both species exhibited much higher genetic diversity and lower genetic differentiation than generally reported for endemic plants. Although the taxa differed in distribution range and density of populations in the study region (local scale), molecular variation within populations was not significantly different between both taxa. H. sinaicum, the taxon with the narrower range and fewer populations, exhibited a stronger population differentiation than O. syriacum subsp. sinaicum, the taxon with the wider range and more populations at the scale of the study. Populations of both species followed the isolation-by-distance model. Bayesian clustering of individuals was successful in identifying several populations with distinct gene pools in both taxa. Conclusions - We discussed recommendations for conservation of each taxon and concluded that the conservation of genetic diversity occurring naturally in these taxa should still be possible by a combination of in situ and ex situ conservation efforts.","[Zaghloul, Mohamed S.] Suez Canal Univ, Dept Bot, Ismailia, Egypt; [Poschlod, Peter; Reisch, Christoph] Univ Regensburg, Inst Bot, DE-93053 Regensburg, Germany",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Suez Canal University; University of Regensburg,"Zaghloul, MS (corresponding author), Suez Canal Univ, Dept Bot, Ismailia, Egypt.",Zaghloul_mohamed@yahoo.com,"Zaghloul, Mohamed/AAE-6896-2020; Poschlod, Peter/AAF-7902-2019","Zaghloul, Mohamed/0000-0003-4828-210X",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),The authors wish to thank Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for providing funding of this project to the first author under the Georg Forster Fellowship for Experienced Researchers.,,78,1,1,0,12,SOC ROYAL BOTAN BELGIQUE,MEISE,"NIEUWELAAN 38, B-1860 MEISE, BELGIUM",2032-3913,2032-3921,,PLANT ECOL EVOL,Plant Ecol.

For its efficient use and conservation, genetic diversity and clonal variation of V. rotundifolia populations in China were investigated using inter-simple sequence repeat markers. Fourteen natural populations were included to estimate genetic diversity, and a large population with 135 individuals was used to analyze clonal variation and fine-scale spatial genetic structure. The overall genetic diversity (GD) of V. rotundifolia populations in China was moderate (GD = 0.190), with about 40% with in-population variation. Across all populations surveyed, the average within-population diversity was moderate (P = 22.6%; GD = 0.086). A relatively high genetic differentiation (G(st) = 0.587) among populations was detected based on the analysis of molecular variance data. Such characteristics of V. rotundifolia are likely attributed to its sexual/asexual reproduction and limited gene flow. The genotypic diversity (D = 0.992) was greater than the average values of a clonal plant, indicating its significant reproduction through seedlings. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed a clear with in-population structure with gene clusters of approximately 20m. Genetic diversity patterns of V. rotundifolia in China provide a useful guide for its efficient use and conservation by selecting particular populations displaying greater variation that may contain required medicinal compounds, and by sampling individuals in a population at > 20m spatial intervals to avoid collecting individuals with identical or similar genotypes.","[Hu, Yuan; Zhu, Yu; Zhang, Qiao-Yan; Xin, Hai-Liang; Qin, Lu-Ping] Second Mil Med Univ, Dept Pharmacognosy, Sch Pharm, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yuan; Zheng, Han-Chen] Chinese Peoples Liberat Army Gen Hosp, Beijing 100853, Peoples R China; [Lu, Bao-Rong] Fudan Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Rahman, Khalid] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Biomol Sci, Fac Sci, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England",Naval Medical University; Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital; Fudan University; Liverpool John Moores University,"Qin, LP (corresponding author), Second Mil Med Univ, Dept Pharmacognosy, Sch Pharm, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",qinsmmu@126.com; brlu@fudan.edu.cn,"Hu, Yuan/G-5244-2011; Lu, Bao-Rong/C-3130-2009","Lu, Bao-Rong/0000-0002-0214-2390",Shanghai Modernization of TCM Foundation of China [04DZ19810],Shanghai Modernization of TCM Foundation of China,Supported by the Shanghai Modernization of TCM Foundation of China (04DZ19810).,,42,9,9,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1672-9072,1744-7909,,J INTEGR PLANT BIOL,J.

As the increasing demand for Wuzhimaotao, the wild F.hirta has been extremely reduced during the past years. It is urgent to protect and rationally develop the wild resources of F.hirta for its sustainable utilization. However, a lack of genetic background of F.hirta makes it difficult to plan conservation and breeding strategies for this medical plant. In the present study, a total of 414 accessions of F.hirta from 7 provinces in southern China were evaluated for the population genetics using 9 polymorphic SSR markers. Results A mean of 17.1 alleles per locus was observed. The expected heterozygosity (He) varied from 0.142 to 0.861 (mean = 0.706) in nine SSR loci. High genetic diversity (H-e = 0.706, ranged from 0.613 to 0.755) and low genetic differentiation among populations (G'(ST) = 0.147) were revealed at population level. In addition, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that the principal molecular variance existed within populations (96.2%) was significantly higher than that among populations (3.8%). Meanwhile, the three kinds of clustering methods analysis (STRUCTURE, PCoA and UPGMA) suggested that the sampled populations were clustered into two main genetic groups (K = 2). Mantel test showed a significant correlation between geographic and genetic distance among populations (R-2 = 0.281, P < 0.001). Pollen flow, seed flow and/or geographical barriers might be the main factors that formed the current genetic patterns of F.hirta populations. Conclusions This is a comprehensive study of genetic diversity and population structure of F.hirta in southern China. We revealed the high genetic diversity and low population differentiation in this medicinal plant and clarified the causes of its current genetic patterns. Our study will provide novel insights into the exploitation and conservation strategies for F.hirta.","[Lu, Yi; Chen, Jianling; Chen, Bing; Zhang, Hanlin; Chao, Zhi; Tian, Enwei] Southern Med Univ, Sch Tradit Chinese Med, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qianqian] Guangzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Canc Hosp & Inst, Guangzhou 510095, Peoples R China; [Yang, Liyuan] Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture, Dept Landscape Plants & Ornamental Hort, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Yang, Liyuan] Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Germplasm Innovat & Utiliza, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China; [Tian, Enwei] Guangdong Prov Key Lab Chinese Med Pharmaceut, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China; [Tian, Enwei] Guangdong Prov Engn Lab Chinese Med Preparat Tech, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China",Southern Medical University - China; Guangzhou Medical University; Zhejiang A&F University; Zhejiang A&F University,"Chao, Z; Tian, EW (corresponding author), Southern Med Univ, Sch Tradit Chinese Med, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China.;Yang, LY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Landscape Architecture, Dept Landscape Plants & Ornamental Hort, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.;Yang, LY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Agr & Forestry Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Germplasm Innovat & Utiliza, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.;Tian, EW (corresponding author), Guangdong Prov Key Lab Chinese Med Pharmaceut, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China.;Tian, EW (corresponding author), Guangdong Prov Engn Lab Chinese Med Preparat Tech, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China.",yangliyuan67@126.com; chaozhi@smu.edu.cn; tianenwei@126.com,"liu, qian/HDM-2936-2022","Yang, Li-Yuan/0000-0001-7327-7527",Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2020A1515010627]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31700328]; Scientific research and Development Fund of Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University [2019FR028]; Open Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Germplasm Innovation and Utilization for Garden Plants,Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific research and Development Fund of Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University; Open Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Germplasm Innovation and Utilization for Garden Plants,This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [grant number 2020A1515010627]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31700328]; Scientific research and Development Fund of Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University [grant number 2019FR028]; and the Open Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Germplasm Innovation and Utilization for Garden Plants.,,56,0,0,5,18,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2229,,,BMC PLANT BIOL,BMC Plant Biol.,12-Jul,2022,22,1,,,,,,,334,10.1186/s12870-022-03734-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03734-2,,,12,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,2X0UP,35820829,"Green Published, gold",,,3/27/23,WOS:000824929300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This was achieved by a collaborative approach that built strong interactions between disparate organisations (ICARDA, VIR, CLIMA, and Australian genebanks) based on germplasm exchange, conservation and documentation, capacity building, and joint collection. These activities greatly strengthened Australian pasture, forage, and crop genebanks, and led to widespread germplasm utilisation that has waned in the last 5 years, reflecting changing priorities among industry funding bodies and research providers. This situation must be reversed, given the pivotal role genetic resource collections must play to broaden the genetic and adaptive base of plant breeding, to meet the challenge of feeding an increasing population in a depleting resource base. Because the use of germplasm subsets that facilitate phenotyping will stimulate wider utilisation of genetic resources, we discuss the application of core collection and germplasm selection through habitat characterisation/filtering in Australian collections. Both are valid entry points into large collections, but the latter has the advantage of enabling both trait discovery and investigation of plant adaptation, and because it is based on a priori hypothesis testing, it increases understanding even when the trait of interest is not identified.","[Berger, Jens D.] CSIRO Plant Ind, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Berger, Jens D.; Clements, Jon C.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Ctr Legumes Mediterranean Agr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Hughes, Steve] South Australian Res & Dev Inst, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Snowball, Richard] Dept Agr & Food Western Australia, S Perth, WA 6155, Australia; [Redden, Bob] Dept Primary Ind, Australian Temperate Field Crops Collect, Horsham, Vic 3401, Australia; [Bennet, Sarita Jane] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Nawar, Fawzy] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas, Aleppo, Syria",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Western Australia; South Australian Research & Development Institute (SARDI); Government of Western Australia; Department of Agriculture & Food - Western Australia; Curtin University; CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA),"Berger, JD (corresponding author), CSIRO Plant Ind, Private Bag 5, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia.",Jens.Berger@csiro.au,"Berger, Jens D./A-9768-2011; Bennett, Sarita Jane/D-8042-2013","Berger, Jens D./0000-0002-8978-5099; Bennett, Sarita Jane/0000-0001-8487-7560; Clements, Jon/0000-0003-0494-9531",Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"This paper is dedicated to Dr Clive Francis, whose passion for international plant collection served as an inspiration to us all.

The study area is a Brazilian National Forest in southern Brazil, established in the 1950s. Genetic analysis was investigated using nine allozyme loci. Significant and positive fixation index was detected for the adults of all studied populations. Although we observed lower levels of genetic diversity and biparental inbreeding in some populations, their pattern of mating, similar to that expected in panmixia, indicates that all populations can be used in conservation planning. Furthermore, the presence of unique alleles and the significant genetic differentiation among all adult populations (F-ST = 0.404) reinforces that all populations are important conservation resources. The average paternity correlation was high in almost all populations, showing that open-pollinated families are composed of mixtures of half-and full-sibs. With regards to conservation strategies, our results suggest that seed collection from at least 133 seed trees is necessary to retain a reference effective population size of 500. Our results confirm that the planted Araucaria forests in southern Brazil can be useful as a genetic resource for conservation, breeding and reforestation strategies for this threatened species.","[Ferreira, Diogo Klock; Nazareno, Alison Goncalves; Mantovani, Adelar; Bittencourt, Ricardo; dos Reis, Mauricio Sedrez] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Mantovani, Adelar] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, BR-88520000 Lages, SC, Brazil; [Sebbenn, Alexandre Magno] Inst Florestal Sao Paulo, BR-01059970 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina,"Nazareno, AG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, CP 476, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",alison_nazareno@yahoo.com.br,"Mantovani, Adelar/AAN-8848-2021; Bittencourt, Ricardo/S-9923-2019; Reis, Maurcio/I-1733-2012; Bittencourt, Ricardo/E-7276-2013","Mantovani, Adelar/0000-0003-2952-2171; Bittencourt, Ricardo/0000-0002-6609-3372; Reis, Maurcio/0000-0003-1331-3367; Bittencourt, Ricardo/0000-0002-6609-3372; Sebbenn, Alexandre/0000-0003-2352-0941; Nazareno, Alison/0000-0001-9681-5877",Capes,Capes(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),We are grateful to the Nucleo de Pesquisas em Florestas Tropicais (Rainforest Research Department) of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) for its assistance during the field work.

They are a major resource that humans depend on to increase farming resilience and profit. Hence, the demand for genetic resources will increase as the world population increases. There is a need to conserve and maintain the genetic diversity of these valuable resources for sustainable food security. Due to environmental changes and genetic erosion, some valuable genetic resources have already become extinct. The landraces, wild relatives, wild species, genetic stock, advanced breeding material, and modern varieties are some of the important plant genetic resources. These diverse resources have contributed to maintaining sustainable biodiversity. New crop varieties with desirable traits have been developed using these resources. Novel genes/alleles linked to the trait of interest are transferred into the commercially cultivated varieties using biotechnological tools. Diversity should be maintained as a genetic resource for the sustainable development of new crop varieties. Additionally, advances in biotechnological tools, such as next-generation sequencing, molecular markers, in vitro culture technology, cryopreservation, and gene banks, help in the precise characterization and conservation of rare and endangered species. Genomic tools help in the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and novel genes in plants that can be transferred through marker-assisted selection and marker-assisted backcrossing breeding approaches. This article focuses on the recent development in maintaining the diversity of genetic resources, their conservation, and their sustainable utilization to secure global food security.","[Salgotra, Romesh Kumar] Sher e Kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Jammu, Sch Biotechnol, Chatha 180009, India; [Chauhan, Bhagirath Singh] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat QAAFI, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia",Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences & Technology of Jammu (SKUAST Jammu); University of Queensland,"Chauhan, BS (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat QAAFI, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia.",b.chauhan@uq.edu.au,"; Chauhan, Bhagirath/G-8892-2014","Salgotra, Romesh Kumar/0000-0001-7605-0926; Chauhan, Bhagirath/0000-0003-1540-4668",,,,,128,0,0,20,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4425,,GENES-BASEL,Genes,JAN,2023,14,1,,,,,,,174,10.3390/genes14010174,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes14010174,,,20,Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Genetics & Heredity,7Z1VS,36672915,"gold, Green Published",,,3/27/23,WOS:000915353100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ex situ plant conservation can be improved through genetic analysis. One area of interest is the relative value of conserving smaller or larger populations and how sampling strategies for these might differ. Current practice emphasizes collecting large sample sizes from some populations and limiting sampling from others and aims for the capture of allele diversity exceeding predetermined thresholds at the species level. Evaluating how well botanic garden collections can capture the genetic diversity of populations of different sizes can help refine guidance on conservation efforts. Methodology. A model species, Pseudophoenix sargentii (Arecaceae), was chosen for its disjunct and insular range, variation in population size, and presence in collections. We compared 123 in situ plants from three discrete island populations with 94 ex situ conservation specimens via 10 microsatellite markers. Comparison of allelic diversity among the wild populations and collections allowed for the evaluation of genetic capture. Pivotal results. Genetic distance analysis, fixation indexes, and Bayesian clustering analysis show discrete in situ geographic structure and close affinity between ex situ collections and in situ source populations. Yet collections from just the largest population met the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation Target 9 threshold for conservation success for that source population, for other smaller populations, and for all populations together. Conclusions. Percent of genetic capture thresholds may need revision, as such thresholds overlook important diversity. Efficient genetic capture is maximized by emphasizing unique maternal lineages and limiting half-siblings in a collection, but this selectivity must be balanced against the need for redundancy in living collections. Large and small populations each contribute to meeting genetic diversity goals. We recommend that botanic gardens and their networks develop conservation priorities based on genetic diversity and resources, carefully consider existing thresholds for conservation success, define metrics for ex situ conservation goals, and integrate analysis into ex situ conservation efforts.","[Griffith, M.

The connectivity between producers, sellers and consumers such as customers of agri-food markets, retailers, food industry and hospitality are relevant for assessing the future implementation of a feasible strategy regarding the rural sustainable development including the conservation of genetic resources for food and agriculture. Sibiu county is awarded for 2019 as a European Region of Gastronomy and therefore a major attention should be paid to city agri-food markets that should be oriented to local products selling. Sellers are among the relevant stakeholders to provide valuable information regarding the food-chain. The scope of this article is to assess the sellers from the largest agri-food market of Sibiu city: Cibin market. Based on this analysis, native products from Sibiu are replaced with similar products from different counties or from import to a share up to 5% even during the harvesting season. However, there is optimism in developing the preservation conditions for more perishable agri-food products that may further improve the selling of local products and as a consequence the maintenance of local resources. Thus, by developing preservation conditions for agri-food products will fuel the appropriate conservation measures implementation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture in a most cost-efficient way.","[Sand Sava, Camelia; Antofie, Maria-Mihaela] Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Fac Agr Sci Food Engn & Environm Protect, 7-9 Dr Ioan Ratiu, Sibiu 550012, Sibiu County, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Antofie, MM (corresponding author), Univ Lucian Blaga Sibiu, Fac Agr Sci Food Engn & Environm Protect, 7-9 Dr Ioan Ratiu, Sibiu 550012, Sibiu County, Romania.",camelia.sand@yahoo.com; mihaela.antofie@ulbsibiu.ro,"Antofie, Maria Mihaela/AAU-3565-2020; Antofie, Maria-Mihaela/AGH-4345-2022",,"Research Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Environmental Protection of the University Lucian Blaga from Sibiu [71065/04.09.2017, 48124/19.06.2018]",Research Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Environmental Protection of the University Lucian Blaga from Sibiu,This study was supported by the contracts nr. 71065/04.09.2017 and 48124/19.06.2018 of the Research Centre for Agricultural Sciences and Environmental Protection of the University Lucian Blaga from Sibiu.

It is used medicinally, provides a highly nutritious supplement to Bedouin diets, provides fodder for livestock, and is used for fire wood. M. peregrina seeds have been a source of high-quality oil for cosmetics and perfumes since antiquity. Due to unmanaged grazing and over-collection, M. peregrina has become one of the most endangered tree species in the Egyptian desert ecosystem. A long-term conservation program is urgently needed to maintain or increase the number and size of M. peregrina populations. Ten populations harboring a total of 130 adult M. peregrina were sampled from three disjunct Wadis in South Sinai (W. Me'ar, W. Fieran and W. Zaghra). Open-pollinated seedlings were electrophoretically analyzed to address two basic questions: (1) how is genetic diversity distributed within and among populations within these three Wadis; and (2) what is the mating system of this species. M. peregrina has a mixed mating system with a selfing rate up to 16% and has limited genetic diversity within and significant genetic differentiation among its populations, the majority of which occurs among Wadis. Direct protection is urgently needed to decrease genetic deterioration within M. peregrina populations and to improve their ability to maintain or improve their population numbers. The priority of in situ conservation should be to conserve a few large well-distributed populations representing different Wadis. Ex situ germ-plasm collections should be made across the species' range to ensure a representative sample of its genetic variation. Seed orchards designed to maximize cross-fertilization among unrelated individuals should be established to generate propagules to supplement natural populations.","[Zaghloul, M. S.; Moustafa, A.

Borderea chouardii is a critically endangered allotetraploid dioecious member of Dioscoreaceae, known from a single population in the Iberian pre-Pyrenees. This population was reported to be highly structured into two genetically distinct groups of individuals corresponding to their spatial separation along the vertical cliff where it grows. In 1999, the Spanish Government of Aragon launched the first conservation programme for the ex situ preservation of this species, and since then a seed collection has been conserved at the Germplasm Bank of the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. However, as some seed samples had not been labelled clearly at the time of collection, their origin was uncertain. Methods Genetic variation in germplasm accessions of B. chouardii was investigated using microsatellite (simple sequence repeat; SSR) markers. Key Results The 17 primer pairs used detected 62 SSR alleles in the 46 samples analysed from five different germplasm stocks. Eight alleles scored from the wild population were not detected in the germplasm samples analysed. The relatedness of the germplasm samples to the wild subpopulations through neighbour-joining clustering, principal coordinates analysis (PCO) and assignment tests revealed a biased higher representation of the genetic diversity of the lower cliff (43 samples) subpopulation than that of the upper cliff (three samples). Conclusions The collection of additional samples from the upper cliff is recommended to achieve a better representation of the genetic diversity of this subpopulation. It is also recommended that these stocks should be managed separately according to their distinct microspatial origin in order to preserve the genetic substructuring of the wild population.","Univ Zaragoza, Escuela Politecn Super Huesca, Dept Agr & Econ Agraria, E-22071 Huesca, Spain; Univ Politecn Madrid, Ciudad Univ, Dept Biol Vegetal, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Segarra-Moragues, JG (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Escuela Politecn Super Huesca, Dept Agr & Econ Agraria, C-Carretera Cuarte S-N, E-22071 Huesca, Spain.",jogasemo@unizar.es,"Iriondo, Jose M./B-3112-2008; Segarra-Moragues, Jos Gabriel/I-7352-2012; Catalan, Pilar/N-7641-2014; Catalan, Pilar/AAL-8833-2020","Iriondo, Jose M./0000-0003-2710-3889; Segarra-Moragues, Jos Gabriel/0000-0003-0061-8647; Catalan Rodriguez, Maria Pilar/0000-0001-7793-5259",,,,,70,5,6,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Most current strategies to establish GCAs have focused on crop wild relative species and proposals have been made mainly for single species or habitats. Moreover, the analysis of current genetic variation was rarely included as a crucial part in the process of selecting target sites for GCAs. To close this gap, we collected data on the genetic variation in three grassland habitats of three species per grassland type to develop a new approach for the selection of target sites for a network of GCAs. First, we used AFLPs to calculate genetic diversity and genetic differentiation at the target sites. Then we determined how many and which populations represent the highest genetic variation within the study region and should be included in a GCA network. The species differed in the number of populations required and the most suitable target sites were not uniform across species. The species showed different patterns of genetic differentiation among populations. This underlines that the inclusion of further sites is necessary, when aiming at the establishment of GCA networks for multiple species. However, in practical nature conservation genetic variation is not the only relevant parameter for the establishment of a GCA network, we suggest a detailed decision-making process for the establishment of the GCA network, including further important factors such as property situation, funding availability, target species or habitat, land use history or landscape structure.","[Gradl, Ellen; Lehmair, Theresa A.; Poschlod, Peter; Reisch, Christoph] Univ Regensburg, Inst Plant Sci, Ecol & Conservat Biol, Univ Str 31, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Gradl, Ellen] Univ Regensburg, Inst Plant Sci, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg; University of Regensburg,"Gradl, E (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Inst Plant Sci, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",ellen.gradl@ur.de,,"Gradl, Ellen/0000-0002-4257-2897; Poschlod, Peter/0000-0003-4473-7656",Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE);  [2813BM001],Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE); ,"Funding The present study was funded as part of the project ?Identification and conservation of historically old grassland? by the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) , Grant Number: 2813BM001.",,70,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

If possible, conservation-related or conservation-oriented articles should be easily written to bridge the research-implementation gap.

We hope that conservation practitioners could employ these suggested guidelines for the prioritization of population- and species-level management.","[Chung, Mi Yoon] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Daejeon 34134, South Korea; [Son, Sungwon] Korea Natl Arboretum, Div Plant Resources, Yangpyeong 12519, South Korea; [Lopez-Pujol, Jordi] Bot Inst Barcelona IBB, CSIC Ajuntament Barcelona, Barcelona 08038, Spain; [Mao, Kangshan] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Bio Resources & Ecoenvironm, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn,Minist Educ, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Chung, Myong Gi] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Div Life Sci & RINS, Jinju 52828, South Korea",Chungnam National University; Korea National Arboretum; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Sichuan University; Gyeongsang National University,"Chung, MG (corresponding author), Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Div Life Sci & RINS, Jinju 52828, South Korea.",mychung@cnu.ac.kr; ssw80@korea.kr; jlopez@ibb.csic.es; maokangshan@scu.edu.cn; mgchung@gnu.ac.kr,,"Lopez-Pujol, Jordi/0000-0002-2091-6222; Chung, Myong Gi/0000-0002-1283-3574; Chung, Mi Yoon/0000-0002-8756-5367","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation (NRF); Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea [NRF- 2020R1I1A3074635, NRF-2017R1A2B4012215]; Korea National Arboretum [KNA1-2-37, 20-4]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U20A2080, 31622015]; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [PID2020-119163GB-I00]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation (NRF)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea; Korea National Arboretum; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government)","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea (NRF- 2020R1I1A3074635 to M.Y.C. and NRF-2017R1A2B4012215 to M.G.C.), and was partly carried out as part of the study on population characteristics and conservation management strategies of rare plants in the Korea National Arboretum (KNA1-2-37, 20-4), who supported M.G.C. in 2021.
